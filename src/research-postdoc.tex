\underline{Data Analysis: Hadronic Supersymmetry}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt]
\item Searching for pair production of gluinos decaying to final states including jets and missing energy with the CMS 2015 and 2016 datasets at $\sqrt{s}=13~\text{TeV}$, using jet multiplicity, b-jet multiplicity, $H_{\text{T}}$ (the scalar sum of jet $p_{\text{T}}$), and $H_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}$ (the magnitude of the vector sum of jet $\vec{p}_{\text{T}}$). Specific contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Release manager for \href{https://github.com/TreeMaker/TreeMaker}{TreeMaker} ntuple production software used for this analysis and numerous others, including calculations and variables for all background estimations and signal selections.
\item Studied and implemented procedures to assess corrections and systematic uncertainties in simulated signal samples.
\item Investigated signal sensitivity for new models and in the compressed region of phase space, including kinematics, binning, and triggers.
\item Helped implement jet reclustering for event reinterpretations to estimate the $\text{Z}\to\nu\nu$ background.
%\item Improving dijet asymmetry non-Gaussian tail estimations for the rebalance and smear QCD background estimation.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\underline{Phase 2 Upgrades}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt]
\item Co-led effort to interface Pandora particle flow algorithm with CMSSW for High Granularity Calorimeter reconstruction:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reorganized and rewrote major portions of related CMSSW code, including modifications for scoping document studies; maintained external library for Pandora algorithms.
\item Improved Pandora computing performance for high pileup events: speedup of 5-10x, reduced memory usage.
\item Provided reconstruction used for performance and physics studies in the Phase 2 Technical Proposal and Scope Document.
\end{itemize}
\item Managed Phase 2 software development efforts in CMSSW:
\begin{itemize}
\item Accepted L3 Upgrade Software Coordinator position in 2016, responsible for maintaining geometries, simulation, digitization, reconstruction, trigger emulation, analysis tools, and workflows with various combinations of subdetectors upgraded for Phase 2.
\item Delivered functioning and efficient workflow to enable Monte Carlo production for Phase 2 TDRs with up to 200 interactions per bunch crossing.
\item Promoted to L2 in 2017, responsible for reviewing all pull requests related to upgrades, release management, approving EPR pledges, and guiding development for subsequent TDR productions.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\underline{HCAL}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt]
\item Radiation damage studies:
\begin{itemize}
\item Demonstrated the degradation of particle flow jet energy resolution with radiation damage at high eta, and improvements from accelerating the SiPM installation and scintillator replacement.
\item Supervised full physics studies and development of more accurate radiation damage models to inform the HE upgrade acceleration decisions.
\item Consulted on analysis of new data regarding degradation of scintillators and electronics.
\end{itemize}
\item Phase 1 software development:
\begin{itemize}
\item Planned and executed the migration of HCAL and related upgrade code to the modern CMS software release.
\item Implemented simulation and digitization code for QIE10 and QIE11 electronics, including significant code cleanup.
\item Improved SiPM simulation to include or update features such as dark current, crosstalk, nonlinearity, pulse shape.
\item Developed workflows for various HCAL upgrade configurations, various tools for testing and debugging, and consulted on reconstruction implementations.
\item Became L3 HCAL CMSSW Co-Convener after role as leading developer for above features.
\end{itemize}
