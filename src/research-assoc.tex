\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt]
\item Leading comprehensive program to search for evidence of dark matter from strongly-coupled hidden sectors in the forms of semivisible jets, emerging jets, and soft unclustered energy patterns.
\item Principal investigator for CaloDiffusion project to to accelerate detector simulation using AI.
\item Lead developer of SONIC (Services for Optimized Network Inference on Coprocessors) in the CMS software to accelerate ML inference using coprocessors as a service; consultant for other experiments (ATLAS, DUNE, IceCube, LIGO).
\item Principal investigator for CODE4hep (Collider Optimization Development Environment for HEP) focusing on Muon Collider use cases, including detector and algorithm design.
