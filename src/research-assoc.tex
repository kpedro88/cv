\section{Research}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt]
\item Leading comprehensive program to search for evidence of dark matter from strongly-coupled hidden sectors in the forms of semivisible jets, emerging jets, and soft unclustered energy patterns.
\item Maintainer and primary developer for \href{https://github.com/TreeMaker/TreeMaker}{TreeMaker} ntuple production software, used for numerous searches (including above).
\item Lead developer of \href{https://github.com/hls-fpga-machine-learning/SonicCMS/}{SONIC} (Services for Optimized Network Inference on Coprocessors) in the CMS software to accelerate ML inference using coprocessors; consultant for same approach in LArSoft for DUNE.
\item Investigating AI denoising to accelerate detector simulation and graph neural networks for accurate, scalable calorimeter clustering.
\end{itemize}
